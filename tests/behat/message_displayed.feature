Feature: SafeAssign displays the submission status for the correct files
  As a Student/Teacher
  I should be able to see the status only for submission done after Safeassign activation.

  Background:
    Given the following config values are set as admin:
      | enableplagiarism | 1 |
    And the following config values are set as admin:
      | safeassign_api | http://safeassign.example.com | plagiarism_safeassign |
    And the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category | groupmode |
      | Course 1 | C1 | 0 | 1 |
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email |
      | teacher1 | Teacher | 1 | teacher@example.com |
      | student1 | Student | 1 | student1@example.com |
      | student2 | Student | 2 | student2@example.com |

      | enabled   | 1 | plagiarism_safeassign |
    Then I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage with editing mode on
    And I add a "Assignment" to section "1" and I fill the form with:
      | Assignment name | Assignment One |
      | Description | Submit your online text |
      | assignsubmission_onlinetext_enabled | 0 |
      | assignsubmission_onlinetext_wordlimit_enabled | 0 |
      | assignsubmission_file_enabled | 1 |
    And I log out

  Scenario: SafeAssign shows Report in progress... text only for submissions done after its activation.

    When I press "Add submission"
    And I upload "lib/tests/fixtures/empty.txt" file to "File submissions" filemanager
    And I press "Save changes"
    Then I should not see "SafeAssign Originality Report in progress..."

    And I press "Save and display"
    And I follow "View all submissions"
    And I should not see "Report in progress" in the "Student 1" "table_row"
    Then I log out
    Then I log in as "student2"
